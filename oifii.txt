2020june19 modif was for attempting to get the 64 bit version working but it fails (maybe) because of 64 bit issues with the freeimage library
the 32 bit version, debug and release, works fine with small 2K images as well as larger 8K but crashes (out of memory) when building pointset/voronoi set,
that is why the 64 bit versoin could become usefull

2020june20 modif will be for integrating OpenCV library
